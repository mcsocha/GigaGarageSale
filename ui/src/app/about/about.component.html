    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>GigaGarageSale was founded by Michael Socha and Danny Xiong, two super dedicated computer help desk technician coworkers at Harvard. While assisting faculty, staff, and students with their computer issues, Michael noticed a recurring trend: many students were in need of affordable computer parts while others were upgrading their systems, leaving their old but still functional components unused.</p>
    <p>This observation spurred on Danny, being an already accomplished E-Bay reseller, to work with Michael to create a dedicated marketplace where gently used computer parts could be bought and sold, providing a solution for budget-conscious students and tech enthusiasts alike.</p>
